# Introduction

At the heart of condensed matter physics is the desire to gain a solid understanding of complex interacting many-particle systems, such as topological insulators, metals, and superconductors. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool for making significant progress in this direction as they allow for a numerically exact and unbiased study of these materials.

It is a Julia [@Bezanson2017] library.

DQMC [@Blankenbecler1981] method.

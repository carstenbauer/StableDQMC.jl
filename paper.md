# Introduction

At the heart of condensed matter physics is the desire to gain a solid understanding of complex interacting many-particle systems, such as topological insulators, metals, and superconductors. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool for making significant progress in this direction as they allow for a numerically exact and unbiased study of these materials. Specifically, the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method [@Blankenbecler1981] has proven [@Schattner2016; @Assaad2016; @Bauer2020] to be effective in the analysis of itinerant electron system featuring strong electronic correlations.

It is a Julia [@Bezanson2017] library.

# Introduction

At the heart of condensed matter physics is the desire to gain a solid understanding of complex interacting many-particle systems, such as topological insulators, unconventional metals, superconductors. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool for making significant progress in this direction as they, in contrast to analytical approaches, allow for a numerically exact and unbiased study of these materials. In particular, the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method [@Blankenbecler1981] has proven to be effective for the analysis of itinerant electron systems like iron- or copper-based high-temperature superconductors [@Schattner2016; @Assaad2016; @Bauer2020]. However, any DQMC application requires careful handling of numerical instabilities which inevitably occur because of an exponentially spread of numerical scales due to the intrinsic energy spectra of such compounds. Various procedures based on different matrix factorizations have been proposed over time to get these instabilities under control. Unfortunately, neither have they been systematically compared with respect to accuracy and efficiency nor have they been provided in code form.

StableDQMC.jl is a Julia [@Bezanson2017] software library which aims to fill this gap. It provides fast and numerically stable implementations of the fundamental computational building blocks of DQMC. In this way, it acts as an important abstraction layer: it allows users to focus on the physical application rather than intricate floating point precision issues.

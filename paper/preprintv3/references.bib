abstract = {We discuss a new functional-integral formulation of interacting fermion systems on a lattice such as the Anderson or Hubbard models: the fermion-fermion interaction is eliminated by introducing auxiliary Ising variables. The resulting model for a d-dimensional quantum system is a (d+1)-dimensional Ising model with complicated interactions. The new transformation is particularly useful for performing numerical studies of these models using Monte Carlo techniques. We study its convergence properties and compare it with the usual Gaussian formulation for the case of the Hubbard model.},

They also claim that the increase in the d-wave pairfield susceptibility $\chi$d(T) of a doped 4 × 4 Hubbard model at low temperature, previously found using this algorithm, is an artifact due to numerical errors. Here, we provide tests which show that this algorithm is numerically accurate and show that the simulation of $\chi$d for a 2 × 2 lattice agrees with exact diagonalization results. We also provide more complete data for $\chi$d on a 4×4 lattice that is consistent with our previous results.},

Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a unique numerically exact and intrinsically unbiased method to simulate interacting quantum many-body systems. More importantly, when QMC simulations are free from the notorious fermion sign problem, they can reliably simulate interacting quantum models with large system size and low temperature to reveal low-energy physics such as spontaneously broken symmetries and universal quantum critical behaviors. Here, we concisely review recent progress made in developing new sign-problem-free QMC algorithms, including those employing Majorana representation and those utilizing hot-spot physics. We also discuss applications of these novel sign-problem-free QMC algorithms in simulations of various interesting quantum many-body models. Finally, we discuss possible future directions of designing sign-problem-free QMC methods.},

Extensive measurements of the SDW correlations in the vicinity of the phase transition reveal that the critical dynamics of the bosonic order parameter are well described by a dynamical critical exponent z = 2, consistent with Hertz-Millis theory, but are found to follow a finite-temperature dependence that does not fit the predicted behavior of the same theory. The presence of critical SDW fluctuations is found to have a strong impact on the fermionic quasiparticles, giving rise to a dome-shaped superconducting phase near the quantum critical point. In the superconducting state we find a gap function that has an opposite sign between the two bands of the model and is nearly constant along the Fermi surface of each band. Above the superconducting {\$}T{\_}c{\$} our numerical simulations reveal a nearly temperature and frequency independent self energy causing a strong suppression of the low-energy quasiparticle spectral weight in the vicinity of the hot spots on the Fermi surface.

Theoretically, the problem of quantum criticality in the presence of a Fermi surface has proven to be highly challenging. However, it has recently been realized that many models used to describe such systems are amenable to numerically exact solution by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques, without suffering from the fermion sign problem. In this review, we examine the status of the understanding of metallic quantum criticality and the recent progress made by QMC simulations. We focus on the cases of spin-density wave and Ising nematic criticality. We describe the results obtained so far and their implications for superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and transport near metallic quantum critical points.

	abstract = {Lattice gauge theories are used to describe a wide range of phenomena from quark confinement to quantum materials. At finite fermion density, gauge theories are notoriously hard to analyse due to the fermion sign problem. Here, we investigate the Ising gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions, a problem of great interest in condensed matter, and show that it is free of the sign problem at arbitrary fermion density. At generic filling, we find that gauge fluctuations mediate pairing, leading to a transition between a deconfined BCS state and a confined BEC. At half-filling, a €-flux phase is generated spontaneously with emergent Dirac fermions. The deconfined Dirac phase, with a vanishing Fermi surface volume, is a non-trivial example of violation of Luttinger's theorem due to fractionalization. At strong coupling, we find a single continuous transition between the deconfined Dirac phase and the confined BEC, in contrast to the expected split transition.},

The topological insulator at finite Hubbard interaction strength is adiabatically connected to the groundstate of the Kane-Mele model. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, magnetic order at large Hubbard U is restricted to the transverse direction. The transition from the topological band insulator to the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is in the universality class of the three-dimensional XY model.

@article{Hirsch1985,
	abstract = {We have studied the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping. We first discuss the properties of the model within the mean-field approximation: Because of the form of the band structure, some peculiar features are found. We then discuss the simulation algorithm used and compare simulation results with exact results for 6-site chains to test the reliability of the approach. We present results for thermodynamic properties and correlation functions for lattices up to 8×8 in spatial size. The system is found to be an antiferromagnetic insulator for all values of the coupling constant at zero temperature in the half-filled-band case, but the long-range order is much smaller than predicted by mean-field theory. We perform a finite-size-scaling analysis to determine the character of the transition at zero coupling. For non-half-filled-band cases, our results suggest that the system is always paramagnetic, in contradiction with Hartree-Fock predictions. The system does not show tendency to ferromagnetism nor triplet superconductivity in the parameter range studied. We also discuss some properties of the attractive Hubbard model in the half-filled-band case.},

Here we show that such a solution is almost certainly unattainable by proving that the sign problem is nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard, implying that a generic solution of the sign problem would also solve all problems in the complexity class NP in polynomial time.},

@article{Loh1990,
	abstract = {We discuss the problems that arise in the numerical simulation of many-electron systems when the measure of the functional integrals is not positive definite. We present theoretical arguments and numerical data which indicate that the expectation value of the sign of the measure decreases exponentially as the inverse temperature P increases, unless the measure is forced to be positive by an explicit symmetry. We therefore conclude that a recent proposal for dealing with the sign problem due to Sorella et al. leads to an uncontrolled approximation. In the cases we have studied it is a good approximation for the ground-state energy, and we present a method for calculating the correction needed to make it exact. However, for some physical quantities, such as the d-wave pair field susceptibility, the neglect of signs can yield misleading results.},

We present results for the two-dimensional Hubbard model with half- and quarter-filled bands. Our results support the existence of long-range antiferromagnetic order in the ground state at half-filling and its absence at quarter-filling. Results for the magnetic susceptibility and the momentum occupation along with an upper bound to the spin-wave spectrum are given.

A trial wave function, which is assumed to be a Slater determinant, is propagated to large imaginary times. The quantum many-body propagator is represented by a coherent superposition of single-particle propagators by means of a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. The resulting functional integral is performed by stochastic methods based on Langevin dynamics. Numerical stability is achieved by orthonormalizing the propagating single-particle orbitals entering the Slater determinant. The problem of the positiveness of the statistical weight is addressed and solved in most cases.

Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. 3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design-a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

abstract = {We discuss a new functional-integral formulation of interacting fermion systems on a lattice such as the Anderson or Hubbard models: the fermion-fermion interaction is eliminated by introducing auxiliary Ising variables. The resulting model for a d-dimensional quantum system is a (d+1)-dimensional Ising model with complicated interactions. The new transformation is particularly useful for performing numerical studies of these models using Monte Carlo techniques. We study its convergence properties and compare it with the usual Gaussian formulation for the case of the Hubbard model.},

@article{Loh2005,
	abstract = {A recent paper by Matuttis and Ito questions the numerical accuracy of a widely-used fermion Monte Carlo algorithm. They also claim that the increase in the d-wave pairfield susceptibility $\chi$d(T) of a doped 4 × 4 Hubbard model at low temperature, previously found using this algorithm, is an artifact due to numerical errors. Here, we provide tests which show that this algorithm is numerically accurate and show that the simulation of $\chi$d for a 2 × 2 lattice agrees with exact diagonalization results. We also provide more complete data for $\chi$d on a 4×4 lattice that is consistent with our previous results.},

@article{Li2019,
	abstract = {Reliable simulations of correlated quantum systems, including high-temperature superconductors and frustrated magnets, are increasingly desired nowadays to further our understanding of essential features in such systems. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a unique numerically exact and intrinsically unbiased method to simulate interacting quantum many-body systems. More importantly, when QMC simulations are free from the notorious fermion sign problem, they can reliably simulate interacting quantum models with large system size and low temperature to reveal low-energy physics such as spontaneously broken symmetries and universal quantum critical behaviors. Here, we concisely review recent progress made in developing new sign-problem-free QMC algorithms, including those employing Majorana representation and those utilizing hot-spot physics. We also discuss applications of these novel sign-problem-free QMC algorithms in simulations of various interesting quantum many-body models. Finally, we discuss possible future directions of designing sign-problem-free QMC methods.},
